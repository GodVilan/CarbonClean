                    </div>
                    <h5 class="info-sub-text">Carbon emission refers to the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases are by-products of human activities such as burning fossil fuels, farming, deforestation, and industrial production. While some level of carbon dioxide is naturally present in the atmosphere, excessive amounts from human activities are disrupting the Earth's balance.

                        <h5 class="info-text">Why Does Carbon Emission Matter?</h5>
                        <h6 class="info-sub-text">Carbon dioxide acts like a blanket around the Earth, trapping heat from the sun. This process, called the greenhouse effect, is natural and necessary to keep our planet warm enough for life. However, human activities have drastically increased the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, making this "blanket" thicker and causing the planet to overheat.</h6>
                        <h6 class=".mb-20">This overheating leads to global warming and contributes to climate change, which can result in:</h6>
