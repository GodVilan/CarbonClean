    "Transportation": {
      "Car": {
        "Global Warming": "Cars burn fossil fuels (gasoline or diesel), releasing CO₂, a major greenhouse gas contributing to global warming.",
        "Air Pollution": "Tailpipe emissions from cars release harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter, which degrade air quality and cause health problems.",
        "Traffic Congestion": "Increased car usage leads to congestion, causing more emissions as cars idle in traffic and burn extra fuel."
      },
      "Bus": {
        "Global Warming": "Buses that run on fossil fuels emit CO₂, but because they carry more passengers, they can be more efficient than cars on a per-person basis.",
        "Air Pollution": "Like cars, buses contribute to smog and respiratory problems through the release of pollutants.",
        "Traffic and Congestion": "Buses also contribute to congestion in urban areas, but well-managed public transport can reduce overall emissions by encouraging people to use public transport over private vehicles."
      },
      "Train": {
        "Global Warming": "Electric trains have lower emissions compared to diesel-powered ones, but overall, rail transport still contributes to CO₂ depending on the electricity source.",
        "Energy Efficiency": "Trains are one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport per person, especially for long-distance travel, but still contribute to emissions if powered by fossil-fuel-based electricity.",
        "Reduced Traffic": "Rail transport can reduce road congestion, leading to fewer emissions from cars and trucks."
      }
    },
    "Buildings": {
      "Electricity": {
        "CO₂ Emissions": "Electricity generated from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas) releases CO₂, contributing to global warming. The higher the reliance on coal-fired power plants, the more CO₂ is emitted.",
        "Energy Efficiency": "Homes with inefficient appliances or outdated infrastructure consume more electricity, leading to higher carbon emissions.",
        "Climate Change": "Increased electricity consumption contributes to overall higher emissions, accelerating climate change."
      },
      "Heating": {
        "Fossil Fuel Use": "Many homes use natural gas or oil for heating, which releases CO₂ and other pollutants.",
        "Indoor Air Quality": "Burning fossil fuels for heating reduces indoor air quality, leading to health issues like respiratory diseases and asthma.",
        "Energy Waste": "Poor insulation and inefficient heating systems result in higher energy use, leading to more emissions and higher heating costs."
      }
    },
    "Industry": {
      "Manufacturing": {
        "CO₂ Emissions": "Manufacturing industries, particularly cement and steel production, are major sources of CO₂ due to the energy-intensive processes involved, like heating limestone and iron ore.",
        "Energy Use": "Industrial plants often rely on fossil fuels for energy, leading to high emissions.",
        "Air Pollution": "Industrial emissions include not just CO₂ but also sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter, which contribute to air pollution and health problems."
      },
      "Construction": {
        "Material Emissions": "Construction activities involve the use of carbon-intensive materials, such as concrete, steel, and bricks, which contribute significantly to CO₂ emissions.",
        "Construction Equipment": "The heavy machinery used on construction sites runs on diesel, contributing to air pollution and CO₂ emissions.",
        "Energy Consumption": "The construction process also requires significant energy, often powered by fossil fuels, further adding to the carbon footprint of the industry."
